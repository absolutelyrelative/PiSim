This is an example of Probability analysis more than a fully-fledged project encompassing multiple software development practices, but it was still very interesting to tackle on the board, and then programmatically!
# PiSim
Did you know that you can approximate the value of Pi with rain?

Okay, this is an extreme case, but coincidentally the only way to obtain possibly real Random values is in nature, making calculating Pi with rain a great option, if you have...a lot of time to spare.

But we'll simulate the rain drops.

Build the .c program and run it.

Output example:
Hello, World!
3.139200
Process finished with exit code 0
